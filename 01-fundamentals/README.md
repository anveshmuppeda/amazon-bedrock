## What is Amazon Bedrock?

Amazon Bedrock is like a **"library of AI assistants"** you can use in your apps. Instead of building AI from scratch, you just call Bedrock's API.

**Think of it as**: Netflix for AI models - access powerful AI without owning the infrastructure.

**Simple Example**:
```
You: "Write a welcome email"
Bedrock: Returns a professional email
```

**Key Benefits**:
- No servers to manage
- Pay only for what you use
- Access to top AI models
- Enterprise security built-in

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI **creates new content** like humans do.

**What it creates**:
- **Text**: Emails, articles, code
- **Images**: Art, photos, designs
- **Code**: Programs from descriptions

**Examples you know**:
- ChatGPT (conversations)
- DALL-E (images from text)
- GitHub Copilot (code writing)

**Key difference**:
- Regular software: 2+2 = always 4
- Generative AI: "Write a poem" = different poem each time

## Foundation Models & LLMs

### Foundation Models
**Super-smart AI brains** trained on massive internet data. One model can do many tasks.

**Examples in Bedrock**:
- **Claude** (Anthropic): Great for conversations
- **Llama** (Meta): Good all-around model  
- **Titan** (Amazon): Enterprise-focused

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
Foundation models that specialize in **understanding and generating text**.

**What they do**:
- Answer questions
- Write content
- Translate languages
- Generate code
- Summarize documents

## Machine Learning Basics

### What is Machine Learning?
Teaching computers to learn patterns from examples.

### Types of Machine Learning

#### 1. Supervised Learning
Learning with a teacher (labeled examples).

**Classification** (Categories):
- Email: Spam or Not Spam
- Image: Cat, Dog, or Bird

**Regression** (Numbers):
- House price: $350,000
- Stock price: $125.50

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Finding hidden patterns without labels.

**Examples**:
- **Customer Groups**: Discover "bargain hunters" vs "premium buyers"
- **Fraud Detection**: Spot unusual transaction patterns

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learning through trial and error with rewards.

**Examples**:
- Game AI: +points for winning moves
- Robot: +reward for reaching destination

## Deep Learning Overview

### What is Deep Learning?
Uses artificial "neural networks" with many layers to understand complex patterns.

**Example**: Recognizing a cat
- Layer 1: Detect edges
- Layer 2: Find features (ears, eyes)
- Layer 3: Recognize "cat"

### Types of Networks

#### Neural Networks
Basic building blocks for simple predictions.

#### CNNs (Images)
Specialized for visual data.
- **Examples**: Photo recognition, medical scans

#### RNNs (Sequences)  
Handle data in order.
- **Examples**: Language translation, speech recognition

#### Transformers
Advanced networks that power modern AI.
- **Examples**: ChatGPT, Claude, Google Search

#### Generative Models
Create new content.
- **Examples**: DALL-E (images), music generation

## Bedrock Key Features

### 1. Multiple AI Models
Choose from different companies' best models:
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Meta (Llama)
- Amazon (Titan)
- Cohere (Command)

### 2. Main Components

**Playground**: Test models before using
**Custom Models**: Train with your data
**Guardrails**: Safety controls
**Knowledge Bases**: Connect to your documents
**Agents**: AI assistants that take actions
**Batch Processing**: Handle large jobs efficiently

### 3. Custom Models (Advanced)

#### Fine-tuning
**What**: Customize existing models with your specific data
**Example**: Train Claude on your company's customer service conversations
**Result**: AI that responds in your brand voice

#### Continued Pre-training
**What**: Add deep domain knowledge to models
**Example**: Train on millions of medical papers to create medical AI expert
**When to use**: Need specialized expertise (legal, medical, technical)

#### Custom Model Import
**What**: Bring your own trained model to Bedrock
**When**: You already have models trained elsewhere

### 4. Processing Options

#### Real-time Inference
**What**: Get immediate responses (like chatbots)
**Cost**: Higher per request
**Use for**: Interactive applications

#### Batch Inference
**What**: Process thousands of requests together
**Benefits**: 50% cheaper, handles large volumes
**Example**: Analyze 10,000 customer reviews at once
**Use for**: Data analysis, content generation at scale

#### Cross-Region Inference
**What**: Use models in different AWS regions
**Benefits**: 
- Faster responses (closer to users)
- Data compliance (EU data stays in EU)
- Backup options if one region fails
**Example**: European users → EU models, US users → US models

### 3. Use Cases

**Content Creation**: Blogs, emails, social media
**Customer Service**: Chatbots, support automation
**Code Generation**: Turn ideas into code
**Document Analysis**: Summarize reports, extract insights

## Essential Terms

### Basic Concepts

**Prompt**: Your question or instruction to AI
```
Example: "Write a thank you email"
```

**Completion**: AI's response to your prompt

**Inference**: The process of AI generating a response

**Tokens**: Text pieces AI processes (≈ 0.75 words per token)

**Context Window**: How much text AI can remember at once

### Model Controls

**Temperature**: Creativity level (0 = predictable, 1 = creative)
```
Low (0.1): "The sky is blue"
High (0.9): "The azure canvas dances with light"
```

**Max Tokens**: Maximum response length

**Top-p**: Limits word choices for quality (usually 0.9)

**Stop Sequences**: Text that tells AI to stop (like "END")

### Model Types

**Foundation Models**: Large, general-purpose AI models

**LLMs**: Models specialized for text

**Embeddings**: Convert text to numbers for search/similarity
