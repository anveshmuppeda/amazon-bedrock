## Machine Learning Basics

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is teaching computers to learn patterns from examples, just like how humans learn.

**Human Learning Example**: 
- You see many cats and dogs with labels
- Your brain learns to distinguish between them
- Next time you see a new animal, you can identify if it's a cat or dog

**Machine Learning Example**:
- Computer sees thousands of email examples labeled "spam" or "not spam"
- It learns patterns (certain words, sender types, etc.)
- When new email arrives, it can predict if it's spam

### The Learning Process:

#### 1. Data Collection
- Gather examples (photos, text, numbers)
- Ensure data quality and diversity
- Label data when needed (supervised learning)

#### 2. Training
- Feed data to algorithms
- Algorithm finds patterns
- Creates a "model" that captures these patterns

#### 3. Testing
- Try model on new, unseen data
- Measure accuracy and performance
- Adjust if needed

#### 4. Deployment
- Use model to make predictions on new data
- Monitor performance over time
- Update as needed

### Types of Machine Learning
